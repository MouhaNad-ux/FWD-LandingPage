# Table of contents

<!-- After you have introduced your project, it is a good idea to add a **Table of contents** or **TOC** as **cool** people say it. This would make it easier for people to navigate through your README and find exactly what they are looking for.

Here is a sample TOC(*wow! such cool!*) that is actually the TOC for this README. -->

- [Landing Page](#project-title)
- [Demo-Preview](#demo-preview)
- [Table of contents](#table-of-contents)
- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Development](#development)
    - [Adding new features or fixing bugs](#adding-new-features-or-fixing-bugs)
- [License](#license)
- [Footer](#footer)

# Usage
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

<!-- This is optional and it is used to give the user info on how to use the project after installation. This could be added in the Installation section also. -->
 This project is a simple fornt End landing page containg number of sections , each section has it's own description.

 There's a Top Navigation menu to enable easy navigation to a specific section.If you reached the botttom of the page

 there's a "Top" button on the right which enables easy scrolling to the top of the page with one click.
# Development
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

<!-- This is the place where you give instructions to developers on how to modify the code.

You could give **instructions in depth** of **how the code works** and how everything is put together.

You could also give specific instructions to how they can setup their development environment.

Ideally, you should keep the README simple. If you need to add more complex explanations, use a wiki. Check out [this wiki](https://github.com/navendu-pottekkat/nsfw-filter/wiki) for inspiration. -->
You can modify the names and contents of any section by editing the headers and the paragraphs for each section 

("index.html" file),  also you can clone a section and paste it below the last section to add a new section.


### Adding new features or fixing bugs
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

<!-- This is to give people an idea how they can raise issues or feature requests in your projects. 

You could also give guidelines for submitting and issue or a pull request to your project.

Personally and by standard, you should use a [issue template](https://github.com/navendu-pottekkat/nsfw-filter/blob/master/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md) and a [pull request template](https://github.com/navendu-pottekkat/nsfw-filter/blob/master/PULL_REQ_TEMPLATE.md)(click for examples) so that when a user opens a new issue they could easily format it as per your project guidelines.

You could also add contact details for people to get in touch with you regarding your project. -->

# License
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

<!-- Adding the license to README is a good practice so that people can easily refer to it.

Make sure you have added a LICENSE file in your project folder. **Shortcut:** Click add new file in your root of your repo in GitHub > Set file name to LICENSE > GitHub shows LICENSE templates > Choose the one that best suits your project!

I personally add the name of the license and provide a link to it like below. -->

[GNU General Public License version 3](https://opensource.org/licenses/GPL-3.0)

# Footer
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

<!-- Let's also add a footer because I love footers and also you **can** use this to convey important info.

Let's make it an image because by now you have realised that multimedia in images == cool(*please notice the subtle programming joke). -->

 <footer class="page__footer">
    <p>&copy Udacity</p>
  </footer>

<!-- Add the footer here -->
